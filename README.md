# CPP20-Cross-Platform-Template
A template for a cross-platform C++20 project including modern CMake, unit-testing with Catch, cross-platform CI and release builds using using Github Actions.

## What's included
- CMake C++20 project skeleton, with strict warning flags enabled when using GCC or Clang.
- Usage of modern CMake practices for setting project-wide compiler options, etc. in a target-focused way.
- Properly exported CMake project that can be used by other CMake projects with minimal effort (no hand-written `FindProject.cmake` files)
- Unit testing using [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2), with automatic test discovery integration with CTest.
- Github Actions config files supporting building and running tests on Linux, macOS and Windows using the following compilers:
    - Linux: GCC-10, Clang-10
    - macOS: GCC-10, Clang-12
    - Windows: MSVC 2019
- Building Releases on each platform when a Github Release is published, uploading these as build Artifacts.
- Doxygen config file with tweaks from the default config settings to provide a few more graphs (usage, caller/callee relationships) than are enabled by default.
- Doxygen docs are also built as part of release builds, and these are uploaded to the gh-pages branch under a versioned URL, versioned to the minor version.
    > For these docs to work properly, you need to observe the expected tag naming format for the tags you select for your Github Releases. The system expects semantic-versioning to be used, with tags of the format `vX.X.X` where `X` is a number. Docs of previous versions of the same minor version are overwritten when a new version for that same minor version is released. Docs of other minor versions are never deleted automatically.

> **Note** There's also a Travis-CI build config for a cross-platform build of similar structure to the Github Actions builds, however this is no longer maintained as Travis-CI has been found to not support more recent versions of CMake on all platforms.

## Usage
1. Click the <kbd>Use this template</kbd> button at the top of this page to create your own new copy of this template
2. Fill in the project details on the next page as you desire
3. Once you've got your new project produced from this template, do a find-and-replace globally within the project with the following substitutions:
    - `my-hovercraft-is-full-of-eels` -> your project name in lowercase. You could use `-` to separate words if you like.
    - `MyHovercraftIsFullOfEels` -> your project name in UpperCamelCase. Recommended to capitalise each word.
    - `MY_HOVERCRAFT_IS_FULL_OF_EELS` -> your project name in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE. Recommended to separate at the words.
    - `com::saxbophone::my_hovercraft_is_full_of_eels` -> an appropriate C++ namespace for your project.

    Also rename the following directories in the same way:
    - `my-hovercraft-is-full-of-eels`
    - `my-hovercraft-is-full-of-eels/include/my-hovercraft-is-full-of-eels`

    - **Choose a Software License for your code** if it is open-source and you want other people to be able to use it with ease!

> The above instructions are the bare minimum required to get your own project based on this template off of the ground. You'll almost certainly want to change more things in `Doxyfile` and definitely `README.md`, but these are documented better in other places and also beyond the scope of this guide.
